# Box Stacking Problem Analysis and Solution Comparison

## Objective
To determine the height of the tallest possible stack of boxes, where each box can only be placed on top of another if it is strictly smaller in width, height, and depth.

## Description of the Problem
Given a list of boxes, each defined by their width, height, and depth, the goal is to compute the height of the tallest stack that can be formed under the condition that each box must be strictly larger in width, height, and depth than the box above it. This problem is derived from Chapter 8 about Dynamic Programming in the book "Cracking the Coding Interview".

## Prompt to LLMs
"You have a stack of n boxes, with widths \( w_i \), heights \( h_i \), and depths \( d_i \). The boxes cannot be rotated and can only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is strictly larger than the box above it in width, height, and depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest possible stack. The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of each box. Please provide the solution script in Python and provide what is the time complexity of your proposed algorithm in Big O notation."

## Methodology
Each solution was implemented and validated using a set of test cases to ensure correctness. The solutions were compared based on their time and space complexities, as well as lines of code (LOC) as a metric for code simplicity and maintainability.

## Test Cases
1. \([(50, 45, 20), (95, 37, 53), (45, 23, 12)]\) - Expected height: 82
2. \([(4, 6, 7), (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (10, 12, 32)]\) - Expected height: 19
3. \([(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5), (4, 5, 6)]\) - Expected height: 14

## Solutions Comparison
Each solution was evaluated based on the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

- **Time Complexity**
- **Space Complexity**
- **Lines of Code (LOC)**

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

1. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Original Solution**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
   - **Lines of Code (LOC)**: 18
   - **Implementation**: Uses iterative dynamic programming with nested loops.

2. **ChatGPT-4o Solution**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
   - **Lines of Code (LOC)**: 33
   - **Implementation**: Uses recursion with memoization, sorts boxes by height.

3. **Book Solution**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
   - **Lines of Code (LOC)**: 41
   - **Implementation**: Similar to the ChatGPT-4o solution, uses recursion with memoization, sorts boxes by height.

4. **Github Copilot Solution**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
   - **Lines of Code (LOC)**: 27
   - **Implementation**: Uses recursion with memoization, sorts boxes by area (width \(\times\) depth).

5. **Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Improved Solution**:
   - **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\)
   - **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
   - **Lines of Code (LOC)**: 44
   - **Implementation**: Uses recursion with memoization, sorts boxes by area (width \(\times\) depth), optimized to properly handle stacking of larger boxes on smaller ones.

## Key Findings
- **Consistency in Complexity**: All solutions have a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) and a space complexity of \(O(n)\).
- **Sorting Criteria**: Solutions differ in their sorting criteria, with some sorting by height and others by area (width \(\times\) depth). Sorting by area often provides a more intuitive initial order for stacking.
- **Recursive vs. Iterative Approaches**: The iterative approach (Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Original) is straightforward and easy to understand. Recursive approaches (ChatGPT-4o, Book, Github Copilot, Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Improved) with memoization avoid redundant calculations and are effective.

## Recommendation
- The **Claude 3.5 Sonnet - Improved Solution** is recommended due to its optimized handling of stacking logic and effective use of sorting by area. It maintains the same time and space complexity as other solutions while providing clear and comprehensive logic.

## Next Steps
- Implement the recommended solution in production environments where optimal box stacking is needed.
- Conduct further testing with a larger variety of test cases to ensure robustness in different scenarios.
